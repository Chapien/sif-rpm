This is a COPR repo to provide an RPM installer for [SIF - Steam Icon Fixer](https://github.com/BlueManCZ/SIF)

Add the repo with `sudo dnf copr enable chapien/SIF`

Once the repo is added, run `sudo dnf install sif-steam`. See the [Readme](https://github.com/BlueManCZ/SIF/blob/master/README.md) for usage details. You should use `sif` instead of `./sif.py` to execute the program for the rpm install, but otherwise usage is the same.

For installation issues relating to the rpm package, please contact me at [inquiries@chapien.net](mailto:inquiries@chapien.net).

For bugs in the actual runtime of SIF, please report them [here](https://github.com/BlueManCZ/SIF/issues).
